📊 Project Title:
AgriMarket Insights Dashboard

📝 Project Description:
Developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze sales and customer activity at a Farmers Market. The dataset included vendors, booths, products, and transactions. This interactive solution provides real-time insights for vendors and organizers to monitor sales, track customer behavior, and optimize product and booth management.

🔍 Approach and Process
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
• Cleaned and structured raw CSV files containing customer, vendor, and transaction data
• Standardized column names, handled missing values, and removed duplicates
• Converted price, quantity, and date fields to appropriate data types

2️⃣ Data Modeling
• Fact Table: Transaction-level sales data
• Dimension Tables:

Customer Table – contains customer ID, name, and location info
Vendor Table – vendor and booth relationships
Product Table – category and product pricing info
• All tables linked via primary-foreign keys like customer_id, vendor_id, and product_id
3️⃣ DAX Measures
• Total_Sales = SUMX(quantity × cost_to_customer_per_qty)
• Total Quantity = SUM(quantity)
• Unique Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(customer_id)
• Customer_FULL_Name = [customer_first_name] & "_" & [customer_last_name]

4️⃣ Power BI Visualizations
• Slicers – Allow filtering by Product, Customer, Vendor, and Date
• KPI Cards – Display total quantity sold, total sales, unique customers, total booths/vendors
• Pie & Donut Charts – Top-selling products and vendor contributions
• Bar Charts & Tables – Top customers by sales and quantity
• Zip Code Analysis – Sales and quantity distribution by customer location
• Word Cloud – Visual emphasis on high-value customers based on purchase volume

📈 Key Insights:
✅ 3 products account for 90%+ of sales → demand is highly concentrated
✅ 30% of customers drive over 50% of purchases → strong case for loyalty programs
✅ Uneven vendor performance → opportunities for inventory/booth reallocation
✅ Only 29 unique buyers out of 1003 total purchases → repeat buyers dominate, potential for outreach

⚒️ Tools & Techniques Used:
✅ Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visuals
✅ Excel (.CSV) for data storage and cleaning
✅ Relationships created between tables using primary/foreign keys (e.g., customer_id, vendor_id)
✅ DAX Measures for Total Sales, Quantity, and KPIs

💡 Use Case / Practical Application:
✅ Market organizers to manage booths and track performance
✅ Vendors to see which products and customers are most valuable
✅ Data analysts to derive actionable business strategies based on patterns and metrics
